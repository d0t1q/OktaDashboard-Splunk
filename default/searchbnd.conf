shortdesc = Calculates the distance between two points represented via latitude and longitude, adding the calculated distance to each event
description = Calculates the distance between two points represented via latitude and longitude. Augments each relevant event with the resultant distance, stored in a field named 'distance' or another field as specified. Latitude and longitude for input must be represented in decimal degree format, though separate input fields may be specified for each. Units are in kilometers by default, but optionally represented in miles.
